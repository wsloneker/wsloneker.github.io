# About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Brown University's [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/), investigating explainability methods for Graph Neural Networks with a particular focus on understanding Gene Regulatory Networks. 

I am advised by Doctors [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/) and [Lorin Crawford](https://lorincrawford.com/).
