# About Me
Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Brown University's [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccmb.brown.edu/people/whitney-sloneker), developing methods to better understand networks with a particular focus on biology applications particulary for the [Integration Initiative: Sex, Aging, Genomics, & Evolution (IISAGE)](https://www.iisage.org/). I am advised by Doctors [Ritambhara Singh](https://ritambharasingh.com/) and [Lorin Crawford](https://lorincrawford.com/).

My graduate studies at Brown were preceded by obtaining a Bachelor's of Science from Caltech. During my undergraduate experiance, I researched the effect of THE1 on Arabidopsis growth at the [Meyerowitz Lab](https://plantlab.caltech.edu/), as well as barcoding methods to maximize the number of cells analyzed through microscopy at the [Van Valen Lab](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/).
